Dangerously ill with a rare blood disorder, and determined to save others suffering his same fate, Dr. Morbius attempts a desperate gamble. What at first appears to be a radical success, a darkness inside him is unleashed and transforms this healer into a hunter.</div>

                <div id="quote-text">You have to understand that "Morbius" was released during a time of great uncertainty. Not a single person on this planet had any idea what the future had in store for them, whether it be in the next 3, 4, or 5 years. And yet, it was because of this tumultuous climate that "Morbius" was able to resonate and touch the hearts of its global audience. When the titular Michael Morbius uttered his famous quote "It's Morbin' Time!", the world stopped spinning; for a moment, people were able to tune out all the noise and chaos erupting around their daily lives and just let go. The power of those 3 words will be studied and enshrined until the end of time.</div>
